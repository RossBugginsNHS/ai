## 🚧 CURRENTLY DEVELOPING THIS TEMPLATE 🚧

**NOTE**: We are currently creating this repository template. We are working on building this framework - we're not actually building a project from this framework. So most of the instructions in here are for if someone was actually using this repository.

### While Developing This Template

**Primary Task**: Help create and refine the ConceptShipAI template repository itself.

**Development Tracking**: All todo items, completed work, and notes are tracked in:
📋 **`/DEVELOPMENT-TRACKER.md`**

Use this file to:
- Track what needs to be done
- Record what's been completed
- Document decisions and rationale
- Note issues and ideas
- Plan next steps

**Instructions below this line** are what the final template consumers will use. Help build out these instructions and the supporting structure.
